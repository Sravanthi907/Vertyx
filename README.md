This repository consists of 

1. What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. 
Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d love to know why you’re proud of it.
2. Tell me about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why I should read it.
3. Tell me about one feature of our product you really like, and why.
4. Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a 
flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4].
5. We have time series data for CPU, memory, and disk usage attached in a CSV-encoded text file. We want to analyze 
the data to better understand what is happening so we can inform our users. Write a program that will read in the full data, bucket each series into five minute intervals, and calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of the data points in each bucket for each series. Your program should print out the calculated statistics for each bucket.
